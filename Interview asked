Find the duplicate char from this list in optimum
a = [1,5,3,5,2]
len_a = len(a)
b = [1,2,3,4,5]
b-a = 4

seq = [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 8, 7, 5]
unique_seq = set(seq)
n = max(seq)
sum_all = n * (n + 1) / 2
sum_unique = sum(unique_seq)
duplicate_num = sum(seq) - sum_unique
missing_num = int(sum_all - sum_unique)
print("Duplicate number is:", duplicate_num)
print("Missing number is:", missing_num)

What  happen if I increase no. of layers in NN

How softmax function works

How activation function works and where to use which one

What is gradient descent and how it works

What are optimization function and how they works

what is transfer learning

How RPN layer works

Why we use activation function in NN.(appart from adding non linearity and if we wont use activation function it will be simple perceptron model)

what is loss function

why we use MSE(to get convergense so that we can differentiate the equation)

What is bias and variance

What you will do to reduce variance (on data set operations)

If you have lots of categorical variables mean alot of string data types in X the what you will use to convert into numerical data types.

what portion of data you will take to test and train (10k samples and 1000k samples)

What is data drift or model drift how will you  identify.

What are the measures to find data drift.
