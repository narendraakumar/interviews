The key difference between these techniques is that Lasso shrinks the less important featureâ€™s coefficient to zero thus, removing some feature altogether. So, this works well for feature selection in case we have a huge number of features.

Traditional methods like cross-validation, stepwise regression to handle overfitting and perform feature selection work well with a small set of features but these techniques are a great alternative when we are dealing with a large set of features.
